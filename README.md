# Banking Risk Mitigation using NLU Studio

In today’s dynamic market environment, a 360-degree view of a client is a key factor for risk mitigation for investment prepositions. Knowing your client is an essential best practice because it acts as a basis to decide whether or not to invest in a particular client. For a customer relationship manager to be successful in taking the right decision, they must operate on pertinent, accurate, and timely information.

What if we can build a tool that can help you gather all the required information about your clients. To help you make an informed decision on whether or not to invest in a client?

This code pattern is a data science driven solution that uses machine learning to build a knowledge graph of the client associations network and related events from data available as open source and performs multidimensional correlation on these to gain insights.

Suppose, there is an investor who wants advice on which customer to invest in or even to understand an existing client’s situation. This application provides real-time trending information pertaining to an organization, from popular news sites, extracts the clients affected by it with the help of [Watson Natural Language Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding). It is achieved with the help of the following code pattern:
* [Augmented Classification of text with Watson Natural Language Understanding and IBM Data Science experience](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/extend-watson-text-classification/)

The information extracted is in compliance with the most important events impacting any organization.
The events demonstrated are-
* Management Change
* Management Default
* Credit Rating
* Strike
* Share Price Deviation

Finally, a flask application connects the algorithm to a UI and enables all such information to be collated in a single place. Thus, helping a relationship manager to understand the current client-network and provide the right advice to the investor.

## Flow

1. The user interacts with the app UI to request relevant information corresponding to an event or a client.
2. The web app UI interacts with the Python-Flask server to receive the required information from the appropriate API.
3. The flask APIs scrape real-time news from popular online news portals.
4. The scraped data is sent to Watson Natural Language Understanding to extract important entities.
5. A configuration JSON file is sent into the flask app, to further prune on the results obtained on Watson Natural Language Understanding.
6. Finally, all the collected information is pushed back into the interactive UI.


## Included Components

* [Watson Natural Language Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding): An IBM Cloud service that can analyze text to extract meta-data from content such as concepts, entities, keywords, categories, sentiment, emotion, relations, semantic roles, using natural language understanding.

4. [Setup the Application on your Localhost](#4-setup-the-application-on-your-localhost)
5. [Running the Python Application](#5-running-the-python-application)

## 1. Clone the repo

Now you're ready to start working with the app. Clone the repo and change to the directory where the sample app is located.
  ```
git clone git@github.com:IBM/banking-risk-mitigation-nlu-studio.git
cd banking-risk-mitigation-nlu-studio
  ```

## 2. Create IBM Cloud service

Create the following IBM Cloud service. Name the service `Bankingriskmitigation`. Select your desired region, organization and space:

  * [**Watson Natural Language Understanding**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding)

  ![](doc/source/images/NLU_Service_instance.png)

  If you wish to change the name of your NLU service instance, be sure to update the service name in `manifest.yml`.


## 3. Setup the Application on IBM Cloud

You can push the app to IBM Cloud using [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli). This will use the services and application name in the `manifest.yml` file.  From the root directory of the cloned git repository, login into IBM Cloud using CLI:
```
ibmcloud login
```

`NOTE: Ensure you are in the same Region, Organization and Space as the Watson Natural Language Understanding service created above.`

To target Cloud Foundry org/space interactively.

## 5. Running the Python Application

This application provides two methods to gather information:

* Event Options
* Client Options

![](doc/source/images/views.png)

A user can click on any of the event triggers, upon clicking one, it provides a list of news items and the clients involved in the same. Suppose, we click on `Share Price Deviation`, a table with the all the information is given, as shown in the below figure:

![](doc/source/images/Share_price_deviation.png)

If we click on the Clients, now it will be filtered as only those who have a Share Price Deviation:

![](doc/source/images/Share_price_deviation-Clients.png)

As shown in the above image, if we click on any one client. We will get a news item, filtered on both the levels, in this case-
* Share Price Deviation
* Bharath Electronics

![](doc/source/images/Client-table.png)

Thus, the built application enables a banking relationship manager to get relevant client ecosystem news in a faster, convenient and a consolidated manner.
